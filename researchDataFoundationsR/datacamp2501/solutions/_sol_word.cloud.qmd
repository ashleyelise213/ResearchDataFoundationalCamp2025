This code serves as a solution to question 1.
```{r}
#| label: word.cloud.solution

# Create a term-document matrix 
tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(
  corpus,
  control = list(
    # Try adjusting this important parameter.  
    # bounds = list(local = c( min.occurences.in.doc, max.occurences.in.doc)),
    tolower = TRUE,
    removePunction = TRUE,
    stopwords = TRUE #,
    # What else would you put here? We'll come back to this.
  )
)


# Exercise 1:  Yes the number is correct.  Start here.
# When you're finished, run this code cell.  Your wordcloud should appear
# Create the frequency table
word.freq <- data.frame(row_sums(tdm)) %>%
    rownames_to_column( var = "word") %>%
    rename( freq = row_sums.tdm.  )




# Exercise 3: Yes the number is correct.  End here
# Create the wordcloud itself
wordcloud <- wordcloud2(
   word.freq
)

# Display the worldcloud
wordcloud
