`Days` is the fixed effect, and  `Subject` is the grouping variable for a random effect on `Days` and the intercept.

```{r}
#| label: mixed.model.data.viz

# Form the base layer with sleep study data and aesthetic assignments
ggplot(sleepstudy, aes(x = Days, y = Reaction, color = Subject)) +

  # Add points for each observation
  geom_point() +

  # Connect each observation of the same subject
  geom_line(aes(group = Subject)) +

  # Add labels
  labs(
    title = "Reaction Times by Days of Sleep Deprivation",
    x = "Days of Sleep Deprivation",
    y = "Reaction Time (ms)"
